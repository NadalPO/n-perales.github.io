Welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in the [Social Sciences Department](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home) at the UC3M under the supervision of [Ignacio Sánchez-Cuenca](https://ignaciosanchezcuenca.wordpress.com/) and [Fran Villamil](https://franvillamil.github.io/) . During the Spring of 2025, I am a visiting researcher at the Department of Political Science of [UC Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/). 

My research focuses on the historical determinants and legacies of collective action and social capital. My dissertation delves into the long-term continuities between the remote past and modern political behavior, with a strong focus on the mechanisms and logics that sustain this persistence. Particularly during aggregated analysis, I explore the role of long-run population and socioeconomic dynamics in constraining or facilitating historical persistence.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master of Social Sciences from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and a BS in Sociology from the Universitat de Barcelona.
